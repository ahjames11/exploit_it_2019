# Preface {-}

Cost analysts historically operate on small, manageable data sets. Preparing data for a task may be tedious and time consuming, but overall achievable. Those days are over. More and more data are being collected, yet its storage and collection are handled under the same strategies as yesteryear. The result is data sets and databases which are difficult, if not impossible, to work with at scale.

This paper discusses an approach to normalize, categorize, and analyze data as applied to a large subset (~ 2,000,000 records) of the OSD CAPE’s CSDR data set. The resulting product is a compact, usable database that can answer any question the data itself is capable of answering, without additional prep work. Example problem sets quickly answered (by virtue of dynamic dashboard) include investigating labor rates over time, cost trends by WBS, and an assessment of cost growth.

The methodologies presented are consistent with data science best practices – formalized by the popular “grammar of data manipulation” implemented in the R software and the related “tidyverse” packages. The goal is to communicate a flexible, scalable thought process which can be applied to the remainder of the CSDR library, as well as any other data set.

This paper was presented at the 2019 International Cost Estimating & Analysis Association (ICEAA) Professional Development & Training Workshop where it received the Best Paper award in theAnalysis & Modeling, Machine Learning category.
